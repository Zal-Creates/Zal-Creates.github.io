    -- browsing & privacy --

improve your online search experience, privacy, security, and autonomy with the following setup:

browser: [waterfox](https://www.waterfox.com/) / [firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/channel/desktop/developer/) / [brave](https://brave.com/)

search engine: [ddg](https://duckduckgo.com/) / [ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) / [brave](https://search.brave.com/) 

adblock: [ublock origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin) (plus [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) for power users)

passwords: [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), or other *non-browser password manager*.

{{< spoiler show="why this is so important">}}
these browsers allow you to use any search engine of your choice with improved privacy and customization. fire/waterfox are open source, but brave comes pre-configured better. the switch should take <15 minutes, and leaving google/microsoft/apple browsing is the first thing everyone should do today to widen their sources of information. adblockers (such as ublock) reduce the amount that websites are able to track you, as well as stifling the manipulative nature of advertising (which affects everyone, regardless of our awareness) and avoiding malicious sites. use an independant password manager rather than browser defaults to avoid security risks.

{{< spoiler show="spotify -> ytm -> tidal">}}
 run ytm/spotify in browser to adblock. tidal is a higher-quality paid alternative with the best artist royalties. ytm/spotify premium are scamming you and artists, don't fall for it. both spotify and youtube run propagandised adverts; spotify is marginally worse
