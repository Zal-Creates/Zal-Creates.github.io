improve your online search experience, privacy, and autonomy with the following setup:

[brave](https://brave.com/) / [firefox dev ed](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/channel/desktop/developer/) browser + [ublock origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin) adblocker + brave/duckduckgo/ecosia search engine

{{< spoiler show="why this is so important">}}
firefox and brave allow you to use any search engine of your choice with better privacy and customization. firefox is open source, but brave comes pre-configured better. they're the 2 best options i've identified - the switch is easy, you can import your settings/bookmarks/etc from most browsers. the switch should take <30 minutes, and minimally leaving mainstream browsers & engines is the first thing everyone should do today to widen their sources of information. get away from google and bing especially!! adblockers (such as ublock) reduce the amount that websites are able to track you, as well as stifling the manipulative nature of advertising (which affects everyone, regardless of our awareness) and avoiding avoid malicious sites. consider using a password manager like bitwarden too, rather than browser defaults.

{{< spoiler show="spotify -> ytm -> tidal">}}
 run ytm/spotify in browser to adblock. tidal is a higher-quality paid alternative with the best artist royalties. ytm/spotify premium are scamming you and artists, don't fall for it. both spotify and youtube run propagandised adverts; spotify is marginally worse
