my site's color design has been chosen for a few reasons:

* my personal preference

* reducing blue light and eye strain

* high-contrast design, particularly bright colors on a black background, is the accessibility standard - but can benefit even those of us without extra accessibility needs

* ultra-dark mode is more energy efficient on modern oled monitors (not that it actually matters, but for the sake of principle)

excessive icons are anti-accessibility, inefficient, and lack proper standardization

hugo was chosen for efficiency, making this site even more nominal to run (again, sake of principle)
