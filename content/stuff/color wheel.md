    rgb-cmy
the red, yellow, blue color wheel is inaccurate. primary colors (red-green-blue) are used for additive light cases, such as monitors, while secondary colors (cyan-magenta-yellow) are used for subtractive, like printing or painting, forming the rgb-cmy color wheel. these colors are more evenly distributed through the visible spectrum of light as further explained [here](https://www.digitalcoloratlas.com/), promoting a more accurate understanding of vision and color mixing.
