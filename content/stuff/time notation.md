time zones are annoying and pointless. dst is ridiculous. pick one (utc) and use it across the world. people would quickly learn what time the sun comes up in their part of the world. dates switching in the middle of the day is the only real inconvenience i see, beyond the switch itself. and then ofc 24h>>>12h format.
- 24h clock

- [yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date format
