    replacing capital letters makes sense
capital letters have very few uses - abbreviations, conveying emphasis/shouting, and of course identifying proper nouns. having 26 distinct symbols for (essentially) 3 purposes is not only highly inefficient from an 'ascii perspective, but also does not provide great distinction between its purposes. shouting/abbreviation can be misconstrued, leading to common texting abbreviations often only being capitalized for emphasis; meanwhile, proper nouns at the start of a sentence have no distinction whatsoever. 

    proposition

my suggestion is to use punctuation symbols for each. optimal symbols are not my focus. abbreviation symbols would be best used for fringe cases or formal writing.

'sybau = SYBAU (acronym) || "idk = IDK (initialism) || obv\ = obviously (clipping)

^emphasis = EMPHASIS

.proper .noun = Proper Noun

    also

this would also contribute to early childhood literacy (through reduced glyphs), efficiency in 'ascii-like systems, keyboard layouts, fonts, etc.
