    the terms aren't that bad...
the purpose of language is to transfer information from one person to another, and so it takes the path of least resistance. if an idea is found without precise linguistic representation, a word or even dialect is created to fill it. this leads to language eventually being a sub-optimally organized patchwork of words, phrases, and dialects - which i think is really cool, but also sometimes annoying. since the introduction of the internet, it has begun evolving even faster than ever before and consequently been met with much resistance, new words being lumped in as "brainrot" along with the short-form, low-effort, and/or high-intensity content they're associated with. this is not exactly accurate, as the harm of modern brainrot content is mostly in the content style itself, rather than the resulting slang. having a distaste towards these new terms is understandable since they are so closely connected with their source, but the distinction is important to avoid mistakenly waging war on the wrong thing. 

that being said, there is certainly an argument to be made that these terms encourage further interaction with their source material. dicussing a specific brainrot - in any way, with anyone, whether positively or negatively - will cause it to stick around longer. so, if you really want it to go away, shut up about it.

    stop scrolling
anyways, stop scrolling shorts/reels/tiktok. by scrolling the moment your attention slips from a piece of content, you are supporting the high-intensity, attention-hoarding system, teaching your brain unhealthy reward systems, and depriving yourself of boredom. if you do still end up in a short-form doomscroll, stop scrolling and make liberal use of your like/dislike features. let each video finish - you'll find it easier to turn off completely by subverting the most harmful part of the system.

    do nothing

better yet, do absolutely nothing for a while. boredom is a critical part of happiness, creativity, and critical thinking. staring at the ceiling may feel like an incredible waste of time - and also be intensely unpleasant at first - but it's so helpful. doubt and self-reflection brew in that emptiness.
