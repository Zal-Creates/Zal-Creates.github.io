large-scale change is painfully slow, so we'll probably extinct ourselves before we actually consolidate to a single measurment system, time system, language, etc - much less radically improve our language or switch to a base 8 number system. however, my pessimism is not a valid reason to stop working on such goals. neither toki pona nor lojban are perfect languages, but they're an effort so i support them. i also intend to make my own alternative, but it's [just as important to be a follower as a forerunner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW8amMCVAJQ). b8 isn't perfect, but at least it's better than b10; metric isn't great, but at least it's better than imperial; democracy isn't great, but at least it's a start.
