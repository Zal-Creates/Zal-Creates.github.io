    -- language is essential to civilization --
one of the most important skills that set humans apart from other life is our capacity for complex language. the ability to share ideas and information allows the next generation to build upon the innovations of the previous, reaching greater and greater heights. over time, the mass of knowledge grows and grows, so progress requires people to become ultra-specialized in a specific field. the purpose of this should be twofold: advance the field and related technology further, and provide a concentrated blast of knowledge back to greater civilization. the second is where i feel we are most lacking currently; academic articles and even wikipedia are written with such passionate detail that the truly important idea never reaches an adequate audience. having those details available is priceless, but reading all of wikipedia is physically impossible. we need a group dedicated to collecting these concentrated blasts of knowledge and spreading them in an efficient and digestable format. a collection of information that every person should have to promote the improved functioning of civilization as a whole, especially as the education system fails to provide.

speaking of which, my suggestions for academia:

    skills > memorization
schools need to apply far more focus to skills like information literacy and critical thinking. having foundational knowledge in topics like language, math, science, and history is also important, but without the skills to individually gather and apply information it's meaningless. teach a person how to think and learn and they'll do so for a lifetime. rote memorization and 'teaching to the test' are not meaningful.

    challenge the gifted & support the struggling
schools need to challenge their gifted students. everyone takes a unique amount of time to learn a given subject, which unfortunately means that the entire group has to wait for the last ones to understand or risk leaving them behind. the students who understand first never get properly challenged, and so never develop a proper work ethic. when they reach adulthood, many fail and have no idea how to handle it. we are wasting so much of our talent, all while leaving the struggling behind or causing them immense stress to keep up in areas they cannot. 

    everyday language > inane verbosity
academic articles are usually written using very complex language that many struggle with, even if they have an adequate understanding of the topic. such language can be very useful for precisely and efficiently passing knowledge to others, but can also hinder comprehension by choosing big words and fancy syntax in places it serves no purpose. striking a balance that makes information more accessible should be highly valued. the stigma around formal vs informal language is stupid, just get the point across in whatever way makes sense. 

    maximum character counts > minimum word counts
minimum word counts in technical writing assignments; we should have maximum character counts, challenging students to identify their core message and then convey it with efficiency and precision, rather than meandering unconcernedly toward the point with maximally verbose use of language, quite possibly as if the point were to be a distant relative held in quite low regard - that is to say, of course, a destination that one would not be especially interested in reaching, much like the point at the beginning of this ridiculous sentence which i feel may have become quite lost and perhaps even distorted in this endless, thickly forested and horribly written example of exactly what our current education system encourages at the behest of capitalism - a system which, might i add, is often considered to be inherently flawed in innumerable ways💀 

    skills-based > degree-based hiring
degree-based hiring and promotion. if someone has the skills required for a position, they should be hired or promoted based on those skills, not academic performance (as appropriate). with the rise of the internet, independant learning has become not only possible but far superior to traditional formats; by continuing to place unnecessary value on a piece of paper, we perpetuate the waste of time and money interacting with a flawed system. 

    social skills and accepting differences
schools need to teach effective communication strategies and foster kindness towards others. we are all just a mind stuffed inside a silly little meat suit, and we desperately need to stop discriminating against people for the very stupidest of reasons.
